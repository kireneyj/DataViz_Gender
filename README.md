This repository stores my final project for Stat302 (Data Visualization). The project contains four different kinds of plots (a histogram/density plot, a map plot, a boxplot with whiskers, and a scatterplot) to visualize the relationship between conservatism, religiosity, and fundamentalism. 

Rmd file can be used as a template.
