This repository stores my final project for Stat302 (Data Visualization). The project contains four different kinds of plots (a histogram/density plot, a map plot, a boxplot with whiskers, and a scatterplot) to visualize the relationship between conservatism, religiosity, and fundamentalism. 

** CORRECTION: In Plot 2, the caption states "the brigher a country is colored, the less sexist its people are on average." - it should be the reverse: brigher color means more sexism, and darker color indicates more sexism on average.
